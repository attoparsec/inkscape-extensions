Inkscape Extensions -- Gears2 and Sprockets

This is a set of Inkscape extensions for creating accurate and configurable profiles of gears and sprockets. These are specifically intended for use in laser cutter work, using the relevant industrial standards and real-world units to make matching a design with a pre-existing component as easy as possible.

To use, simply place these files in your Inkscape extensions directory ($HOME/.config/inkscape/extensions). Under the Extensions -> Render menu you'll now find entries for Gears2 and Sprockets.

Gears2.py and involute.py are based on http://arc.id.au/GearDrawing.html by Dr A.R.Collins.

Both scripts took inspiration from the original gears.py by Aaron Spike and Tavmjong Bah.
